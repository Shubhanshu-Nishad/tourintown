                <h4>CAN YOU WORK WITHIN A CERTAIN BUDGET?</h4>
                <p>Yes, we work within any and all realistic budgets, and an honest sharing of ideas and goals helps us immensely when making recommendations and suggested edits to travel plans.</p>

                <br>
                    
                <h4>DOES IT COST MONEY TO GET A QUOTE?</h4>
                <p>No, there is no fee for our vacation planning services as the travel vendors involved recognize our value and compensate us from the gross amount paid (what you would have paid even without our assistance). For those complicated international itineraries that require custom crafting and significant involvement of our international on-location partners, we do request an intent-to-travel deposit to begin the process. This deposit is applied to the reservations that are made on your behalf.</p>

                <br>
                
                <h4>WHAT IMPORTANT INFORMATION SHOULD I HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH BEFORE CONTACTING YOU OUT?</h4>
                <p>Ideally you should set a budget and share it with us, so that we can give you a realistic, fun, and memorable itinerary for a price you are comfortable with.</p>

                <br>
                 <h4>IS THE INFORMATION I GIVE ON THE NET SAFE? </h4>
                <p>Any correspondence exchanged between you and Tourintown will be kept confidential and not outsourced to any third party under any circumstances. The credit card details you provide are safe since our Payment Gateway is approved. Moreover your profile (name, Email ID, address, Telephone number) will be used only to communicate with you in regards to the services you are buying or availing. At no time will this profile be misused. </p>
                <br>

                 <h4>DOES TOURINTOWN PROVIDE RELIABLE INFORMATION? </h4>
                <p>The information provided on the site is true and reliable to the best of our knowledge. Moreover various Tourism Boards have been helpful in getting us the required information and we at Tourintown are very thankful to them for their cooperation. Some of the content has been acquired from official sites of Govt. of India Tourist Office, M.P Tourism, Himachal Tourism, Karnataka Tourism, Tamil Nadu Tourism, Maharashtra Tourism, Rajasthan Tourism, Kerala Tourism with prior approval. A lot of general information on INDIA has also been sourced from brochures of Govt. of India Tourist Office. Therefore we feel that the information given on the site is very authentic. 
</p>
                <br>

                 <h4>WHAT IF I DO NOT LIKE ANY OF THE TOURS LISTED ON THE SITE? CAN Tourintown TAILOR-MAKE A TOUR FOR ME?</h4>
                <p>Yes, Tourintown can tailor make your tour as per your desires & requirements. You can advise us the cities you wish to visit. You will also have to inform us some other factors like duration, number of people traveling together and choice of hotels you prefer. As soon as we have these details from your end, we will design a tour especially for you and get back immediately. These details serve as an outline for our Travel experts, who are working here round-the-clock to tailor make your tour. 
</p>

                <br>
                
                <h4>HOW DO I CANCEL A TRIP?</h4>
                <p>Call us right away. If it’s after normal business hours, please contact the next involved travel supplier (airline, hotel, tour operator, cruise line) to cancel any reservations you will not be able to use. If you purchased travel insurance, please contact the insurance company’s 24-hour line to start the cancellation process and ensure your maximum refund.</p>
